Week 8 Friday Test
==================

Objectives
----------
* To revise Ruby methods

Requirements
------------
* There are 41 questions - you don't have to do every single one , but complete at least 50%
* Check if they are correct by running the specs
* Keep the solutions short (not more than a couple of lines of code). I have managed to keep all of the first section of the methods to one line. 

How to use
----------
* To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

To run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~

Next steps
----------
* There is always more than one way of doing something in Ruby, so next steps would be to write each solution another way, trying to refactor and clean up the code as I go along.
